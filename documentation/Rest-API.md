## Data passing

For all the create and update operations the ressources attributes will be passed as query parameters and sent in the HTTP body with content-type [`application/x-www-form-urlencoded`](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application/x-www-form-urlencoded#The_application.2Fx-www-form-urlencoded_type).

## Operations loggings<a name="logging"></a>

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ------ | ----- | ----- | -----: |
|  access[\*](#required) ([0 = private, 1 = public])  |  `Integer` | Access to the Resource | 0 (private) |
| created_at[\*](#required)  |  [`Time`](#time)   | Resource creation date. | NULL |
| created_by[\*](#required)  |  `Integer`| Resource creator user_id. | NULL |
| updated_at[\*](#required)  | [`Time`](#time) | The update logs. **Already filled at creation (same as created_at)**| NULL |
| updated_by[\*](#required)  |  `Integer` | The update logs user_id. **Already filled at creation (same as created_by)** | NULL |
| deleted_at[\*](#required)  | [`Time`](#time)  | The delete log. | NULL |
| deleted_by[\*](#required)  |  `Integer`| The delete log user_id. | NULL |
| created_by_nickname [\*](#required)  |  `String`| Resource creator nickname. | NULL |
| updated_by_nickname [\*](#required)  |  `String` | The update logs nickname. | NULL |
| deleted_by_nickname [\*](#required)  |  `String`| The delete log nickname. | NULL |

<a name="required">* = required</a>

Backend generates `created_by_nickname` from `created_by`.


### Time<a name="time"></a>

Time format is `Combined date and time in UTC:  2012-05-16T07:09Z` defined in ISO 8601.

## Reset operation

To allow the cleaning of the database after the unit tests, a reset Rest Endpoint has to be implemented. 

It must have the following URI with the delete operation: 

**DELETE** `ROOT/VERSION/reset` 

## Tags<a name="tags"></a>

| Name | Type | Description | Default |
| ------ | ------ | ----- | ----- |
| tags | `String` | Array of JSON key/value tag as URL encoded String. `{"key":"value", "key":"value"}`. Returned as object. | NULL |

Tag is a new optional field created to add a possible scope information. For example, with the futur addition of channel scope, a category could contains a tag "{'channel_id':'1234'}". It would logically mean that this category is related to the mathematics channel. 

A tags field could contains more tags, simply comma-separated. 

To simply querying on it, a new list query parameter should be implemented. See [here below](#wiki-tags-query) under the list queries.

For video, category, track and annotation, a tag named "channel_id" can be present to defined the entity scope.


## [Upcoming](Roadmap.md): List queries <a name="list-queries"></a>

For query on list like on [tracks](rest-track#getAll), [annotations](rest-annotation#getAll) or [categories](rest-category#wiki-getAll) different url parameters are accepted. They are always the same for all the list queries.

**The frontend does not use the list querying in the current version.** 

### Parameters<a name="listparam"></a>
