# Opencast Annotation Tool

The Opencast Annotation Tool (aka Annotating Academic Video by Entwine) is a video annotation service that is suitable for research, teaching or learning.

The software devides currently into two parts:

* The frontend component, containing the annotation webapp.
* The Opencast Backend modules, that need to be integrated into an Opencast installation. A recent version of the i
  frontend is already included in the annotation-tool module.
